        <hr>
        <img src="images/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="profile-pic" width="200" height="225">
        <p>Georgia born, Virginia raised, I've pretty much lived in the area my whole life despite being in a military
          family. I moved off base to Stafford when I was 13 and have lived there since aside from my time on campus for
          school. Most of my childhood was spent playing video games and watching anime which hasn't really changed as
          I've grown - I just have substantially less time to do either sadface.jpg. I went to VCU and majored in
          Chemistry (boy if I could go back and redo that) and graduated in 2015.
          <br>
          <br>
          After college and a brief period living with my brother in Maryland, I got a job at Quest Diagnostics as a
          Medical Technologist in Chantilly. It was a fine job and certainly a decent living when all you have is a
          bachelor's in Chemistry but I eventually found myself a bit bored by it. The job is extremely unchallenging
          and
          nothing really changes. In June of 2018, I started teaching myself how to code following some discussion with
          a
          friend of mine who was enrolled at the GW bootcamp/masters program at the time. I enjoyed teaching myself what
          little I did and
          I figure that no matter what field you are working in, in the future you're going to need to know how to code
          -
          so why not get serious about it now?
          <br>
          <br>
          I signed up for the GW bootcamp last November and started teaching myself some of the stuff in the cirriciulum
          since I had lots of time and so I wouldn't come in and be <em>toooooo</em> incompetent. Long story short - I
          was
          able to get a job as a junior engineer with one of the DoD contractors. So that's neat, I won't start for a
          while still though.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some hobbies of mine include: watching films (I have a list of ones I want to watch before I die), video
          games,
          anime, skydiving. I also just started going to the gym so maybe that will become a thing.
